#docstring

		Up above the world so high,
		Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,

print("Twinkle , twinkle, litle star,\n\t How I wonder what you are!\n\t\tUp above the world so high,\n\t\tLike a diamond in the sky.\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star,\n\tHow I wonder what you are")

"""Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
